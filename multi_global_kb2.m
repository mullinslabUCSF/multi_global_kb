% polymerase that requires monomeric actin for barbed end association.

% This function performs a global grid search to find a least-squares, best
% fit solution for heterologous, multi-protein interactions in the 
% analytical ultracentrifuge. The function assumes that a labeled molecule 
% binds to multiple, unlabled (hence invisible) molecules. Additionally the
% function assumes that data have been collected at three different
% centrifuge speeds in a six-channel centerpiece with three sample wells. 
% The concentration of the dark molecule can vary but the unlabeled
% molecule should be present at the same concentration in all channels. 
% Finally, to reduce the number of search parameters, the model assumes
% that the cooperative (or anti-cooperative) effect is the same for every
% molecule that binds after the first one (i.e. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc.).

% OUTPUT VALUES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
